<div class="main"><div class="title">ABOUT ME</div>
<img src="assets/images/archery.PNG" width="150" align="left" alt="archery!" class="round">My name is Sammy and I am a future web developer.<p>
I have had a passion and interest in webpages and web development since I was a child in the late 90s. I love the simple act of creation, but also enjoy troubleshooting when things don't go just as planned. I work well in teams and alone, and I can manage stressful deadlines.<p>
I'm an amateur gardener and active participant in the local Community Gardens here, where I helped build gardens and currently manage and sustain them as a site leader.<p>
I stay active with running, but have also dabbled in archery, as we all have dreams of being Amazon warriors, right?<p>
I also use my creative outlets in other ways and am an avid knitter and novice seamstress. Nothing truly tries your patience the way un-knitting two 100-stitch rows because you messed up on one stitch 240 stitches back.
